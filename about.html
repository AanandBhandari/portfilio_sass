        <h3>Sofsee Tech Pvt. Ltd.</h3>
        <h6>Workshop Instructor</h6>
        <p>
          This workshop was intended to give an introduction to web development using nodejs, expressjs, ejs and mongoDB
           for those who have had pusring Bsc.CsIT on my campus and had no previous experience or exposure to this platform.
            It was ideal for anyone who would have liked to understand its basics without
           digging too deep into the nitty-gritty details, but still walked away with a good understanding of what the 
           nodejs can do by making a simple CRUD app.
